				<h3>a. Things Learned During the OJT</h3>

				<table>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Working with other people</b></td>
						<td>I didn't have close friends with me on Team ISKO.  This was the first time I was on a team with Ann Janeth and John Paul. It was a challenge for me to be comfortable working with them. After months of working with them, I can say that they were good people and good friends. They were fun to work with and so understanding, I am grateful that I got to work with them.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Share my own ideas</b></td>
						<td>I shared ideas better this time with my teammates and my employers. Back then, I am anxious to share some of my thoughts with other people because I might be wrong. But with the help of my teammates, I was able to communicate my ideas to them because they were open to ideas being shared.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Improved my Task 
						Management Skills</b></td>
						<td>We were assigned to have Clickup accounts for each team for task management. I was the scribe for our team. This role helped me manage my tasks and ours as a team too. By recording notes every meeting, I became aware of almost everything that is talked about. This task helped me improve my communication skills by listening.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Improved Backend Skills</b></td>
						<td>Being one of the backend developers of our team, I learned a lot more about the backend side of coding. I was able to do and learn more about Django and databases. I was able to make models, API, and serializers now when back then, I didn't quite understand any of it. I also contributed to developing our login and signup functionality which involved using Djoser and authentication tokens.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Improved Frontend Skills</b></td>
						<td>Even though my role is only a backend developer of our team, I volunteered to work on our frontend side. I worked on the screen responsiveness of each page created. It gave me the experience of developing using Vue.js, Vuetify, and media queries.</td>

				<div class="first-sentence"><span>I am grateful to be a part of the developing team at CIT-U Wildcat Innovation</span></div><div class="text"><span>Labs. The learnings and friends that I made were a very great experience for me. Even though I was not</span><span> close with my teammates at first and instead of being on the frontend side I was given the role as a</span><span> backend developer . I took the opportunity to get out of my comfort zone. My team and employers</span><span> helped me accomplish my tasks well and be a better developer and a worker.</span>
